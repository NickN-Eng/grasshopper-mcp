# Connection Test - Verify component wiring works correctly
# Tests the most critical feature: connecting components

# Create a simple math graph: Slider -> Addition -> Panel
add "Number Slider" 100 100
add "Number Slider" 100 200
add "Addition" 300 150
add "Panel" 500 150

# Verify all components were added
assert_count 4

# Get component IDs
list

# Note: In actual test execution, the tester would need to:
# 1. Parse the list output to get component IDs
# 2. Use those IDs to wire components
# For now this is a placeholder showing the test intent

# For AI: You can extend this by:
# 1. Using the console tester's scripting capabilities
# 2. Or create a more sophisticated test runner that parses output
# 3. Or use the McpTestRunner.cs which does this programmatically
